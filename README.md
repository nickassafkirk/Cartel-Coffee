## Overview

The purpose of this project is to build a mobile responsive website for a new coffee shop in Dublin called Cartel coffee. By creating this site the business wants to increase their online visibility, increase revenue and to attract new customers to their business. They wish to introduce the ability to receive takeaway orders and start selling coffee and associated products online.     
They want to use the site as a platform to update customers on business updates and as a means to continue trading if their restaurant is forced to close during Covid-19 lockdown restrictions.     
The goal of this project is to build a mobile first site which meets the intial business needs while providing an excellent user experience for site users. 

**NB:** *This is a fictional business created for educational purposes only*

---
## UX

The intention of this site is to enable new and existing users, who are searching online, to find cartel coffee and to learn about the business's background, products and services. 

The primary business goal is to convert customers who are landing on the site into physical customers at the business's location. 
To achieve this goal, the site's key focus is to provide the functionality to allow customers to make bookings to dine at the caf√©, to order food for collection and to generate general enquiries from potential customers landing on the site.

The secondary goal of this site is to generate new revenue streams by offering coffee and associated products for sale online, by phone or email and to generate additional takeaway revenues by linking to 3rd party takeaway apps such as deliveroo, just eat, uber eats etc... 

This website is designed to provide 4 distinct functions:
  1. Contact: The site must enable customers to contact the business.
  1. Order: The site must enable customers to order food remotely.
  1. Buy: The site must enable customers to buy products remotely.
  1. Inform: The site must inform customers of key information about the business.

The site must cater to broad range of users. Individual users may be interested in one or more of the 4 site functions in a single session. To aid conversion, emphasis is made to create multiple inter-linking navigation pathways between site pages. This enables users to access the information that is relevant to them, 
while ignoring information that may not be relevant at that moment. 

To provide a great user experience every effort has been made to ensure that information is displayed clearly in a logical order of importance. 

To increase brand awareness and provide a consistent user experience for online and offline customers, the website has been designed to mirror the styling of the business's physical location. 
As this is a fictional business, the images depicted in the homepage carousel have been chosen to reflect the business's theoretical in-store appearance.

## Skeleton

### Navigation

1. **Main Navigation:** A consistent top nav bar is present across all site pages to allow navigation through various pages. 
    ![main nav screenshot](assets/images/readmeimgs/main_nav.png)
     Bootstrap navbar expand/collapse classes were used to improve user experience on mobile devices.

     The navbar menu items are listed in order of importance. With the business's primary services listed in order of priority from left to right or top to bottom on mobile.
    
    ![main nav collapse screenshot](assets/images/readmeimgs/navbar_collapse.png)
    
    I chose to align the navbar collapse icon and collapsed to the menu to the right as [research shows](https://www.livescience.com/what-causes-left-handedness.html) that 85% - 90% of users are right handed and right-alignment results in marginally easier use for right-handed users.
    The Active class is used highlight the current page.
    
2. **Footer navigation:** A consistent bottom footer allows users to navigate between additonal site pages and sections to those included in the main navbar located in the page header. This aids navigation to next point of interest once a user has scrolled down the page.
   Many of the footer items link to specific page section IDs, allowing more targetted navigation to specific sections of information on the site. The footer links essentially list the company's key products and services to teach users the scope of the businesses products and services and encourage 
   conversion from user to customer by allowing users to quickly navigate to their area of interest while ignoring information that may be irrelevant or distract.
   Additional links such as the about page, privacy policies and T&Cs have been added to footer as they are important pages to include on the site but do not merit inclusion in main navbar. 

    ![footer nav screenshot](assets/images/readmeimgs/footer_nav.png) 

3. **Images as links:** Images and Image tiles are used throughout the site to link strong, descriptive visual images to relevant pages. Popular categories and shop categories are represented as image tiles and overlying text, hover functionality and highlighting are strategies used to reinforce that an image is a link. 
    ![navigation tile screenshot1](assets/images/readmeimgs/Menu_Buttons.png)
    ![navigation tile screenshot2](assets/images/readmeimgs/Shop_Buttons.png)

4. **Buttons:** Buttons are used to reinforce form submission or to create a strong emphasis that a link to another page, page section or external site is present. Consistent button coloring is used across site to drive home the functionality of buttons on the site. Clear button labelling is used to 
    encourage first-time learning and correct use of buttons on the site.
    ![Buttons navigation screenshot](assets/images/contact_form_new.png)

    **Button Hover:** Hover functionality has been used to highlight clickable links with bright contrasting colors, in order to reinforce interactivity of animation elements and encourage first time learning. 
    On touch devices clickable elements are highlighted to display that a button or link is in use. 

    ![](assets/images/Hover.png)

5. **IDs as links:** IDs have been used to allow quick navigation to specific points on a single webpage. This is designed to aid conversion by bringing the user directly to their point of interest without the potential to get distracted. 
   The use of Id based navigation also allows more distinct information to be condensed onto a fewer number of pages for a better user experience, a more condensed site and faster page load times. The footer utilises several id's as links to specific sections
   on the menu, shop and contact pages.

6. **Secondary Navigation Bar:** A secondary navigation menu is utilised on the menu page to allow swift navigation to a user's desired menu section. 
    This is particularly useful on mobile devices where a lot content stacks vertically making it necessary for users to have to scroll down throught page content to get to the bottom of the page. 
    The secondary navigation menu uses a page specific color palette to reinforce it's specific association to the menu page. The submenu
    links to specific page section IDs as outlined the the section above.

## Surface

### Fonts
**General**
Sans-serif fonts have been chosen site-wide for a minimilistic style, consistent with the companies interior decor and to improve legibility for site users.
Font-size and line height are adjusted on different device sizes to ensure correct distribution of information and layout across all devices. Adding additional line height and text-padding to clickable links on smaller screenwidths adds additional space between links to 
aid navigation and touch-interaction on touch-screen devices.

**Logo & Title Fonts**
The Bebas Neue font is used for the company logo, carousel image titles and section headings. It was chosed because of it's bold appearance and clear readability. This font has been styled to be uppercase with a heavier font-weight than the body text
to create recognisable branding and obvious visual impact for key site information. 

**Body Fonts**
The Montserrat font was selected for the body text for it's slim, legible and professional appearance. A much lighter font-weight is used to reinforce an overall minimilistic style 
and to create contrast between branding text and headings. 

**Headings**
Headings also utilise the Bebas Neue font to reinforce that section headings denote the start of key sections of information with a higher priority of importance than accompanying body text.

**Additional Fonts**
The Sans-serif font has been chosen as a fallback font if chosen fonts cannot be loaded from external resources.

---

### Colors
Colors are used to increase contrast, visual impact and to improve readability across the site. A grey, blue and white color palette has
been chosen to add a neutral professional and minimalistic site design and to appeal to a broad range of users. Specific section areas are styled with consisted coloring to reinforce the correlation between different areas of relevant content. 
Root variables were used to allow quick design changes to be made. The main colors used on this project are as follows:

**`--custom: #212121;`** This is the primary brand color a dark grey pantone used for the navbar, footer background and homepage section headings. 

**`--tealgrey: #343a40;`** This is the secondary brand color used for page section headings and buttons.  

**`--logo: #333333;`** This is a dark grey color used for the site's body text.  

**`--bg: #eeeeee;`** used for body background, borders and outlines.   

**`--light: #dddddd;`** used for light text where dark backgrounds are used and contrast is needed to aid readability.  

**`--lighttrans: rgba(228, 228, 227, 0.95);`** used as div/container background colors to highlight areas of specific information and to contrast background images and improve readability.   

**`buttonblue: #07c5ff;`** used as primary button background color upon hover or click to encourage click interaction and to indicate link interactivity and successful button submission.  

**`alertorange: #f9c043;`** used as secondary call to action color specifically for alerts. A bright call to action color was used to draw the user's eye to key information. The orange color does not
adhere to the grey, blue, white color motif chosen for the project in order to communicate that the alert information is general information not specifically linked to the current page subject.
    
**rgba values** of `rgba(0,0,0, 0.(n))` were used throughout the site to create text-shadows and image masks promoting better contrast between text and background items
and to create a highlight effect on hover for clickable image tiles to show new users that these are clickable objects.

**`#fff:`** White text has been used for titles and blocks of text where masks and overlays have been utilised where the `--light` color listed above did not provide adequate text and background contrast.

**`#1d1d1d`:** This very dark grey color is used for the coffee menu section background. It was chosen to emulate a coffee pegboard that is popular in many contemporary cafes and specifically the menu
that is depicted in the homepage carousel 1 image. A darker indent style border is used to create a sense of negative relief to further emmulate this pegboard style menu.

**`#007bff`:** A darker browser default blue color has been used for links on the submit.html and about.html pages and the covid-19 alert where the preferred link color `--buttonblue` did not provide adequate contrast against lighter backgrounds. 

### Use of colors:

**Navigation colors:** Dark, muted header and footer colors are used to give a sense of space and contrast to the main and footer navigation. 

**Body colors:** In contrast the body text utilises light, subtle background colors with dark text colors to clearly distinquish the page content from the navigation. 

**Call-to-action colors:** Buttons, Links and alerts utilise really bright vibrant colors to encourage click behaviour and to act as eyecatching visual indicators of primary call-to-action elements.

**Heading colors:** Bold colored headings clearly define where individual sections begin. Boldly colored section background contrasted with light fonts are chosen to clearly define the purpose of each section of information.

**Section Background colors:** Colored sections with muted grey backgrounds are used to clearly distinguish relevant areas of information. This is important as page sections are scaled to width on larger screen-widths to keep information condensed and easily readable.

---

### Icons
Icons are used as metaphors to reinforce meaning of key navigation elements. The paper plane icon is used to reinforce meaning of send/submission buttons, food and drink icons are used on the menu page to 
reinforce the sub-menu navigation buttons and Icons are used for the contact information and social media links to clearly apply meaning to text-heavy page sections like the footer. Icons are also used to reinforce the meaning of short snippets of text in the shop trust mark sections. 

All icons utilised for this project were sourced from [fontawesome.com](https://fontawesome.com/).

---

### Images 
Images are used in several instances on the site to act as strong visual cues and to break-up and add additional context to sections text. 

**Carousel Images:** Eye catching images are used on the homepage carousel to clearly indicate the businesses key activities. These are chosen to encourage users to understand the purpose of the business as soon as they land on the homepage. The carousel images are also chosen to display the business's physical location to show new users what to expect when they visit the store. 

**Homepage Image Tiles:** Appealing images are used as clickable tiles for the menu category navigation links and shop caetgory navigation links on the homepage. These images are included to quickly visually communicate the type of content a user will be brought to when clicking on each image tile. 

**Product images:** Studio images are used to clearly display a products purpose and to encourage users to buy. Clear striking product images are contrasted with plain backgrounds to put the emphasis on the product and to keep user focus on the key information on the page.

**Background-images:** Subtle background images with added opacity are used to give users a greater understanding of the business's style and appearance without drawing away from the key information on each page. These background images and colored divs are also used to break-up large areas of white-space
for a more visually appealing appearance and a more defined flow of information through the page. Background images utilise a relevant subject matter to the page subject to again reinforce the meaning of each page to first time users. 

---

### Animations
Animations and Hover functionality are used to highlight the interactivity of links and buttons encouraging users to use navigation elements. 
Pseudo classes such as hover, focus and active also provide user feedback by highlighting when an element is clickable and by validating when an action has been performed.
In future iterations of this project, I hope to allow animations associated with links to take place before users are redirected to the link destination to provide a better 
user experience on touch screen devices where hover is not possible.

## Testing

The current deployed version of this project has been thoroughly tested to ensure a great user experience on most common device types.
Testing has also confirmed compatibility with all common browsers to accommodate a great user experience and predictable functionality 
for easy as many users as possible. 

The responsive functionality of the site has been tested to work on most common devices with a 320px screen-width and larger. 

The full testing can be found in [the separate testing.md file](testing.md)

---

## Validation: 

### HTML   
All html files were validated using the [W3C markup validation service](https://validator.w3.org/)

**Errors:** 
There were no errors for the deployed version of this project.

**Warnings**
There were no errors for the deployed version of this project.

### CSS

All css files were validating using the [W3C CSS validation service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

![W3C Css validation badge](assets/images/vcss-blue.gif)

**Errors:** 
No errors were returned for the deployed version of this project.

**Warnings**
33 warning messages were returned during validation of the deployed version of this site. These warnings are due to some specific css features not being supported by the Jigsaw validation service and can therefore be **ignored**.

*Vendor Prefixes*   
23 warning messages are due to the use of vendor prefixes. This is because the vendor prefixes are browser specific properties and are not in the official CSS specification and therefore 
return warnings during validation despite being considered good practice to ensure cross-browser compatibility. 
This issue is outlined in the [following article](https://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/201101/css_validator_to_report_vendor-specific_extensions_as_warnings_not_errors/) 
and in [this stackexchange forum](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1889724/how-to-validate-vendor-prefixes-in-css-like-webkit-and-moz)
Therefore these warning messages can be ignored. 

*Root Variables*    
10 warning messages are due to the use of root variables used for colors and fonts on the site. These are returning warning messages upon validation 
because root variables are currently not supported by the validation service despite being widely supported across popular browsers. 
This issue has been outlined at [this link](https://github.com/w3c/css-validator/issues/111) and therefore the warnings can be ignored.

## Code 

The code in this project was written by me ([Nick Kirk](https://github.com/nickassafkirk)) the project owner. Any code snippets written by other developers or found from online resources have been credited
in the credits section below.

### Frameworks
**Bootstrap** CDN was used to create a responsive site design. Several bootstrap components were utilised including navbar, jumbotrons, alerts, modals, forms and the collapse functionality. 
Custom CSS was used to apply unique styling to bootstrap components.

### Code Credits
- To fix issues with footer content alignment I read documentation on flexbox at [This article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Aligning_Items_in_a_Flex_Container)
  I confirmed how to implement flexbox utilities while using Bootstrap by reading the documentation on [this page](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/utilities/flex/)

- To create a more understandable submenu functionality for the submenu on the menu.html page I used a scroll functionality that I learnt about in [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24739126/scroll-to-a-specific-element-using-html)
    ```
    html{
        scroll-behavior: smooth;
    }
    ```
    Unfortunately this scroll functionality is not supported by all browsers and devices but as it is supported by most modern browsers it's use was deemed appropriate for this project. It was not within the scope of this project to produce a scroll behaviour by alternative 
    means that is supported by all browsers and devices.

- To vertically center the carousel caption text on the index.html page. I used the transform technique as described in [this forum](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27279865/how-to-vertically-center-a-bootstrap-carousel-caption)
 from which I utilised this snippet of css:

    ```
        .carousel-caption{
        top: 50%;
        transform: translateY(-50%);
        bottom: initial;
        }

        .carousel-item{
        -webkit-transform-style: preserve-3d;
        -moz-transform-style: preserve-3d;
        transform-style: preserve-3d;
        }
    ```

- As an alternate method to add background opacity to page sections I used a method which utilises pseudo elements that I found published by [Andy Hattemer and Nicholas Cerminara in this article](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-change-a-css-background-images-opacity)
    ```
    /* You could use :after - it doesn't really matter */
    .demo_wrap:before {
        content: ' ';
        display: block;
        position: absolute;
        left: 0;
        top: 0;
        width: 100%;
        height: 100%;
        z-index: 1;
        opacity: 0.6;
        background-image: url('https://assets.digitalocean.com/labs/images/community_bg.png');
        background-repeat: no-repeat;
        background-position: 50% 0;
        background-size: cover;
    }
    ```

- Inspiration for animation used in menu.html subnav was from [this stack overflow discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42745506/how-to-make-an-icon-spin-with-i-tag-in-html5-through-css3) and general animation info was found at [this page](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_animation-keyframes.asp)
    ```
        $(document).ready(function() {
            $('.js-spin').click(function() {
            $(this).addClass('icn-spinner') //remove class to stop animation
            });
        });

    i {
    font-size: 40px;
    }

    .icn-spinner {
        animation: spin-animation 0.5s infinite;
        display: inline-block;
    }

    @keyframes spin-animation {
        0% {
            transform: rotate(0deg);
        }
        100% {
            transform: rotate(359deg);
        }
    }
    ```

- To find a way to hide the homepage menu tile headings upon hover, I was inspired by a method described in [this stackoverflow article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9913293/change-text-on-hover-then-return-to-the-previous-text/9913526)
    ```
    a:hover span {
    display:none;
    }
    ```
- To enable modals to appear upon page load by default I found a solution at [this article](https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/faq/how-to-launch-bootstrap-modal-on-page-load.php#:~:text=Answer%3A%20Use%20the%20Bootstrap%20.,modal('show')%20method&text=modal('show')%20method%20for%20launching%20the%20modal%20window,to%20subscribe%20the%20website%20newsletter.)
 I edited this simple script 
    ```
    $(document).ready(function(){
        $("#shopmodal").modal('show');
    });
    ```
 
- To apply favourable modal positioning I used a technique described in [this article](https://css-tricks.com/considerations-styling-modal/)
    from which I utilised this snippet of code 
    ```
        .modal {
        position: fixed;
        top: 50%;
        left: 50%;
        transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
        }
    ```

- To change the icon displayed when showing/hiding a bootstrap collapse component I used a technique found in [this article stackexchange forum](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19024218/bootstrap-3-collapse-change-chevron-icon-on-click)
    
    ```
    HTML:
         <a data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapseExample" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseExample">
            Open/Close collapse
            <i class="fa fa-chevron-right pull-right"></i>
            <i class="fa fa-chevron-down pull-right"></i>
        </a>

    CSS:
        a[aria-expanded=true] .fa-chevron-right {
        display: none;
        }
        a[aria-expanded=false] .fa-chevron-down {
        display: none;
        }
    ```

- To add a wiggle functionality to the menu pages call Icons/Images, I customised code found at [this codepen demo](https://codepen.io/theDeanH/pen/zBZXLN)
The original is as seen below:

    ```
    p:hover {
    -webkit-animation-name: wiggle;
    -ms-animation-name: wiggle;
    -ms-animation-duration: 1000ms;
    -webkit-animation-duration: 1000ms;
    -webkit-animation-iteration-count: 1;
    -ms-animation-iteration-count: 1;
    -webkit-animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;
    -ms-animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;
    }

    @-webkit-keyframes wiggle {
    0% {-webkit-transform: rotate(10deg);}
    25% {-webkit-transform: rotate(-10deg);}
    50% {-webkit-transform: rotate(20deg);}
    75% {-webkit-transform: rotate(-5deg);}
    100% {-webkit-transform: rotate(0deg);}
    }

    @-ms-keyframes wiggle {
    0% {-ms-transform: rotate(1deg);}
    25% {-ms-transform: rotate(-1deg);}
    50% {-ms-transform: rotate(1.5deg);}
    75% {-ms-transform: rotate(-5deg);}
    100% {-ms-transform: rotate(0deg);}
    }

    @keyframes wiggle {
    0% {transform: rotate(10deg);}
    25% {transform: rotate(-10deg);}
    50% {transform: rotate(20deg);}
    75% {transform: rotate(-5deg);}
    100% {transform: rotate(0deg);}
    }
    ```
