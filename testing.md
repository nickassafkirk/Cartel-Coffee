## Common Elements:

### Navbar 
**Aim:** Navbar is expected to be located fullwidth at the top of all pages. Navbar logo and links should scale to fit larger/smaller screenwidth and 
avoid overflow. Navbar should expand/collapse at set breakpoint.    
**To test:** Window was expanded and collapsed to ensure navbar occupies full screenwidth on all screenwidths and ensured that navbar expands and collapses at the correct breakpoints. Ensured that fonts scale to avoid overflow on different screensizes. 
navbar functions as intended.   
**Outcome:** Navbar functions as intended across all screensizes. 



 ### Navbar Logo:

 **To Test:** To test this I checked that clicking the logo linked on all pages linked back to the site homepage.   
 **Outcome:** The outcome was as expected. 

 ### Navbar links: 
 **Aim:** I expect each link to take the user to the relevant page.  
 **To test:** I verified that the navbar links link to the correct page on all site pages and that the correct active class is displayed for each page.     
 **Outcome:** I verified that the navbar links work as intended for all pages

 ### Navbar expand/Collapse
 **Aim:** On smaller devices navbar links collapse into the burger stack icon. Expected behavior is that a dropdown menu will open and close by clicking burger stack icon.       
 **To Test:** Clicked the burger stack icon on all pages and touch and cursor devices. Expanded and minimized the viewport to test the collapse functionality.       
 **Outcome:** Verified that burger stack functions as anticipated on click, that the navbar expands/collapses at the correct breakpoint and that navbar items are aligned to right as desired.

 **Aim:** Footer should occupy 100% screenwidth across all screensizes and be present at the bottom of the page at all times.
 The footer columns should re-shuffle at 768px breakpoint to ensure proper display on smaller screenwidths. 
 **To Test:** Checked footer presence on all pages. Checked that footer re-order collumns at the correct breakpoint by expanding/minimizing viewport and testing on tablet and mobile devices.  
 **Outcome:** Footer is present on all pages and scalles correctly for good responsive design. 

 ### Footer links

 **To Test:** To verify this I tested every footer link on each site page by clicking each link to ensure that footer links were linking to the desired page. 
 **Outcome:** Footer links work as intended

 ### Social media links
 **Aim:** The social media links are intended to link the instagram, facebook and twitters homepages respectively.

 **Outcome:** Social media links work as intended.

## index.html

 ### Welcome section: 
 Aim: On desktop it is intended that the full welcome paragraph is revealed. On mobile the paragraph becomes a + icon which reveals a collapsed paragraph on click. 
 Outcome: To test this I verified the + icon and collapse paragraph are not displayed on screenwidths greater than 576px. I also verified that the welcome text is 
 displayed as intended across browsers. 

 To test mobile functinality I ensured that clicking the + icon expands the collapsed paragraph card. This functionality is functioning as intended. 

 Menu categories:

 I also tested that the image tiles link to the correct section Id's on the menu page. 

 Links/Buttons:
 Aim: All links andd buttons should link to the correct page or section labelled in the link or buttons. Links that point to external sites and resources 
 should have target set to _blank to ebsure a new tab is opened to ensure easy navigation back to site is possible. 
 Outcome: To test this I tested all links to ensure links point to correct urls and target attributes are set correctly. 

 Forms:
 Inputs should provide validation hints if required fields are not filled out. If validation does not occur, form submission should be prohibitted. 
 Upon successful submission page should reload to a submission success page to notify the user of successful form submission.

 Checked that validation messages occur if requered fields are left empty. 
 confirmed that page reloads to success page upon succesfful validation and submission.
 Outcome: Forms operate as intended.
