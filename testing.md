## Testing

Index.html

Navbar 
Aim: Navbar is expected to be located fullwidth at the top of all pages. Navbar logo and links should scale to fit larger/smaller screenwidth and 
avoid overflow. Navbar should expand/collapse at set breakpoint.
Outcome: ensured that navbar expands and collapses at the correct breakpoints. Ensured that fonts scale to avoid overflow on different screensizes. 
navbar functions as intended. 
 
 Navbar Logo:
 Aim: When clicking the brand logo I expect to be taken to the homepage (index.html).
 Outcome: To test this I checked that clicking the logo linked on all pages linked back to the site homepage. 
 The outcome was as expected. 

 Navbar links: 
 Aim: I expect each link to take the user to the relevant page. 
 Outcome: To test this I verified that the navbar links link to the correct page on all site pages. 
 I verified that the navbar links work as intended for all pages 

 Navbar expand/Collapse
 Aim: On smaller devices navbar links collapse into the burger stack icon. Expected behavior is that a dropdown menu will open and close by clicking burger stack icon. 
 Outcome: Verified that burger stack functions as anticipated on click and that navbar items are aligned to right as desired.
 
 Footer links
 Aim: Footer links are expected to link to their relevant page or page section.
 Outcome: To verify this I tested every footer link on each site page to ensure that footer links were linking to the desired page. 
 
 Social media links
 Aim: The social media links are intended to link the instagram, facebook and twitters homepages respectively. 
 Outcome: To test this I verified that all footer social media links link to the correct website across all site pages. 

 Welcome section: 
 Aim: On desktop it is intended that the full welcome paragraph is revealed. On mobile the paragraph becomes a + icon which reveals a collapsed paragraph on click. 
 Outcome: To test this I verified the + icon and collapse paragraph are not displayed on screenwidths greater than 576px. I also verified that the welcome text is 
 displayed as intended across browsers. 

 To test mobile functinality I ensured that clicking the + icon expands the collapsed paragraph card. This functionality is functioning as intended.

 I also tested that the image tiles link to the correct section Id's on the menu page.

 Inputs should provide validation hints if required fields are not filled out. If validation does not occur, form submission should be prohibitted. 
 Upon successful submission page should reload to a submission success page to notify the user of successful form submission.
